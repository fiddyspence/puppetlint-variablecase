To test the fix functionality of this plugin, open a terminal in this folder and run:

puppet-lint --only-checks variable_contains_upcase --fix test.pp

The test should find uppercases in variables on lines 1 and 3.  Examining test.pp after
running the test should show that the variable $FileName has been changed to $filename.
